The purpose of USE_IEEE_INTRINSICS macro:

GNU Fortran (gfortran) inlines IEEE_FMA as an FMA instruction when available,
so it is cheap to use the intrinsic.

Intel Fortran (ifx, ifort) does not.

===

For the parallel strategies, please reduce the optimization level
with the GNU compilers, or switch to the Intel ones.
